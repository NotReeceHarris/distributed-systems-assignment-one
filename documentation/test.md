# D&D Character Sheet System Test Documentation
Date: November 18, 2024
Tester: QA Team
Build Version: 1.0.0

## Test Environment
- OS: Windows 11 Pro
- Python Version: 3.11.5
- Dependencies: websockets, tkinter
- Network: Local testing environment
- Test Duration: 2 hours

## Test Cases and Results

### 1. Server Initialization
**Test Steps:**
1. Run server.py
2. Check for successful startup message
3. Verify port binding

**Expected Outcome:**
- Server starts without errors
- Port 8765 successfully bound
- Character sheet storage initialized

**Actual Outcome:**
✅ PASSED
- Server initialized correctly
- Port binding successful
- Storage system created empty character sheet dictionary

### 2. Client Connection
**Test Steps:**
1. Start server
2. Launch multiple client instances (3 clients)
3. Monitor server logs for connection events

**Expected Outcome:**
- Each client receives unique ID
- Server logs show successful connections
- Clients display connection success message

**Actual Outcome:**
✅ PASSED
- All clients connected successfully
- Unique IDs assigned (client_001, client_002, client_003)
- Connection status properly displayed in client UI

### 3. Character Sheet Submission
**Test Steps:**
1. Fill out character sheet in client_001
2. Submit sheet
3. Check server logs
4. Verify other clients receive update

**Expected Outcome:**
- Data properly serialized
- Server receives and stores sheet
- Other clients updated immediately
- No data loss during transmission

**Actual Outcome:**
⚠️ PARTIAL PASS
- Data serialization successful
- Server storage working
- Broadcasting functional
- Minor issue: 200ms delay observed in client updates

### 4. Error Handling
**Test Steps:**
1. Send malformed character sheet data
2. Disconnect client during transmission
3. Attempt to send empty character sheet
4. Test reconnection handling

**Expected Outcome:**
- Server rejects malformed data
- Graceful handling of disconnections
- Empty sheets prevented
- Successful reconnection with data resync

**Actual Outcome:**
❌ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
- Malformed data correctly rejected
- Disconnection handling works
- **Bug Found:** Server crashes when receiving empty character sheet
- Reconnection successful but takes 3 attempts

### 5. Load Testing
**Test Steps:**
1. Connect 10 simultaneous clients
2. Each client submits character sheet
3. Monitor system performance
4. Test rapid updates from multiple clients

**Expected Outcome:**
- All connections maintained
- No data loss
- Response time under 500ms
- Server remains stable

**Actual Outcome:**
⚠️ PARTIAL PASS
- Successfully handled 10 connections
- No data loss observed
- **Performance Issue:** Response time increased to 1.2s with >8 clients
- Memory usage stable

## Bugs Found

### Critical
1. Server crashes on empty character sheet submission
   - Priority: High
   - Reproducible: 100%
   - Workaround: Implement client-side validation

### Major
1. Performance degradation with >8 clients
   - Priority: Medium
   - Impact: Response time increases exponentially
   - Suggested Fix: Implement connection pooling

### Minor
1. 200ms broadcast delay
   - Priority: Low
   - Impact: Minimal user experience impact
   - Suggested Fix: Optimize broadcast queue

## Recommendations
1. Implement client-side validation before submission
2. Add connection pooling for better scaling
3. Optimize broadcast mechanism
4. Add automatic reconnection logic
5. Implement proper error messaging system

## Test Coverage
- Unit Tests: 85%
- Integration Tests: 70%
- UI Tests: 60%
- Performance Tests: 50%

## Next Steps
1. Address critical server crash bug
2. Implement performance optimizations
3. Add more comprehensive error handling
4. Develop automated test suite
5. Conduct security testing

## Notes
- Testing conducted on local network; real-world performance may vary
- Additional testing needed for different OS environments
- Security testing pending
- Load testing with >10 clients recommended for production deployment
